= Rider Source Generator issue demo

IMPORTANT: this project uses .NET 9.

. build (`dotnet build`)
. run: `dotnet run --project app/app.csproj`, the output is `Seen=a method seen by the generator`

Now go in Rider and open `Program.cs`, it is reported as if source generator was not functional even after a first compilation and the generated sources are not visible in solution view (on the left).
